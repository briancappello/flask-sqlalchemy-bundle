* better docs for individual meta options (docstrings would be a good start)

* tests for individual meta options
    > make sure meta options don't interfere with the stock SQLA way of doing things

* investigate if it's possible to improve the slugify/events experience by using meta options

* improve reversible op migrations (only used by materialized views at the moment)
  - pretty sure it needs some kind of way to lookup which revision contains the
    prior reversible op declaration for the table that's being migrated

* improve docs for performing data migrations, dealing with nullable -> not null, etc

* document lazy_mapped, bundle inheritance and overriding behavior
    > esp quirks regarding relationships and backref
