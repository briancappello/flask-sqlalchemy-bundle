* better docs for individual meta options (docstrings would be a good start)

* investigate if it's possible to improve the slugify/events experience by using meta options

* see if we can't implement materialized views using meta options. would be awesome
  if their dependent models could be made lazy_mapped
    > also, maybe it's possible to auto-add the Index on the __table__'s pk?

* improve reversible op migrations (only used by materialized views at the moment)
  - pretty sure it needs some kind of way to lookup which revision contains the
    prior reversible op declaration for the table that's being migrated

* improve docs for performing data migrations, dealing with nullable -> not null, etc

* document lazy_mapped, bundle inheritance and overriding behavior
    > esp quirks regarding relationships and backref

* investigate validation
  > moonshot goal is something that works below both Flask-WTF and Marshmallow,
    allowing for DRY validation whether using forms or an API
